 - title: Room For the Big Guys
   body: <p>At BeagleBoard.org, we are very much about enabling innovation from everyone, no matter what size their organization. That's why we encourage distributors to keep their pricing model flat. That's why we make sure our components are available from distributors in quantity one and don't require non-disclosure agreements to get the documentation. Our goal is to make solutions accessible and enable the best technology to win. Sometimes, technology from the big guys can be part of the solution.</p><p>This month has seen big announcements from big players in Internet of Things (IoT) and 3D printing technologies very relevant to BeagleBoard.org community members. BeagleBoard.org community members are already making a lot of use of tools from Bug Labs, Apigee, PubNub, Weaved and many more, several of which are also summarized on <a href="http://www.ti.com/ww/en/internet_of_things/iot-overview.html">TI's Cloud Ecosystem Partners page</a>. Many are also using <a href="http://beagleboard.org/blog/2015-01-28-thought-leadership-regarding-internet-things/">Canonical's Ubuntu Snappy Core</a>   I'm talking about Microsoft's Azure Certified for IoT announcement, Canonical's AppEnabledHome initiative and Autodesk's opening of the Ember 3D printer.

            <p>With projects seeking to simplify exploring the final frontiers of our oceans and outer space, this Summer has shaped up to be an interesting one. Each of the eight (8) students participating generated introductory videos to make it easy for people to understand how they plan to contribute. Looking to make better use of the on-board microcontrollers or simply to get started flashing boards, programming and following tutorials? Maybe you are looking to use an Android tablet as an inexpensive display or to access hardware from an Android application? Whatever your interest, it is worth spending a few minutes checking out the student videos.</p>

            <p>Now that device tree overlays are part of the mainline Linux kernel, the next big step is getting CapeMgr itself upstream. Pantelis has made an initial submission and Robert has integrated that against the 4.1 kernel for BeagleBone Black. Time for everyone to give it a try.

            <p>PocketNC successfully raised $355,833 USD with 280 backers in their Kickstarter campaign. They limited the number of participants to make sure they could execute successfully in a reasonable time frame. PocketNC is one-of-a-kind, benefiting from the unique abilites of BeagleBone Black to run Linux, perform fast processing and to handle the real-time tasks of driving stepper motors. No other solution exists to get so much performance and flexibility into such a small and affordable package.</p>

            <p>There are a lot of IoT toolkits out there, but this one seems to have a lot of key pieces in place, mostly due to the experience of the people involved. They include a BeagleBone Black cape to provide the required connectivity and a collection of useful sensors. They also support a huge variety of languages and APIs. Yet another IoT framework? Perhaps it is worth a look.</p>

            <p>When used in conjunction with the open source sigrok suite of apps, BeagleLogic can be used to analyze over 30 digital protocols including I2C and SPI.</p>
            <p>The BeagleLogic project now includes an optional cape for signal conditioning.</p>
