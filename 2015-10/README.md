# Hot of the presses
I believe I updated the book since the 2015-07 newsletter

# Projects 
 
 
# Featured products
Ideally, all featured projects point to project pages at http://beagleboard.org/project.
* I believe I pulled an LED tutorial from here and put it on beagleboard.org/project:  https://learn.adafruit.com/category/beaglebone
 
# Community Activity
Ideally, these point back to BeagleBoard's Google Group to drive more participation there. Including some to point to Element14's community site would be fine.
