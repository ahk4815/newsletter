 title: Summer Robotics Projects
 body: <p><a href="https://beagleboard.org/blue">BeagleBone Blue</a> is taking off, literally as you can see in this <a href="https://youtu.be/B1DssoXzUXw">Tech Talk with Gus</a> of GHI Electronics where Jason Kridner chatted about the usage of BeagleBone programmable real-time (PRU) microcontrollers in applications like quadcopters and the <a href="https://www.renaissancerobotics.com/edumip.html">EduMIP educational robot</a>. The code for both is already in the Debian package feeds, so getting started should be simple. Mark and Jason just got back from the American Society for Engineering Education annual conference where they introduced teaching robotics using BeagleBone Blue to a capacity audience of University-level educators and a capacity overflow audience of students and you can check out <a href="https://beagleboard.org/show/asee">that presentation</a>. There's even a new book released if you need some extra hand holding. If you act today, you can make a proposal to add a thermal camera and get the camera and a BeagleBone Blue for free!</p><p>So much capability to build advanced robotics projects has never before been integrated into as an affordable kit, so I hope you'll check out what projects others are up to this summer and decide to tackle one of your own.</p><p><em><strong>&mdash;Christine Long</strong>, Executive Director</em></p>
