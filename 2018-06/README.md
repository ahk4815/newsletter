Applying patches before build_kernel.sh?
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!category-topic/beagleboard/n-SteDuSzX4
You can stick them really anywhere, it's probably easiest at the end..
create your own dir: patches/my_patches/
then at the end of patch.sh just add:
dir 'my_patches'
and it'll work it's way from 0001-<>.patch -> 0XYZ-<>.patch

Debian Testing (2017-04-30) U-Boot Overlays are now enabled by Default
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!category-topic/beagleboard/1ahosuHBUTo
It's that time, U-Boot Overlays are now enabled by Default.
With no /boot/uEnv.txt changes you can swap in a 4/7 lcd panel
(*supported) and the image will seamlessly use the lcd overlay.
http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBoneBlack_Debian#2017-04-30
Remember the biggest gotcha is U-Boot, we now rely on U-Boot being the
most upto date, specially for new LCD's or anything that needs
eMMC/HDMI/WL18xx disabled to be utilzed.
