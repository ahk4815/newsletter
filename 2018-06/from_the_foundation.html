        <p>The newest and smallest addition to the BeagleBone family, the <strong><a href="https://beagleboard.org/pocket">PocketBeagle</a></strong>, has been demonstrated by our own Jason Kridner in a <a href="https://www.arrow.com/en/research-and-events/videos/pocketbeagle-maker-fair">Maker Faire Reveal</a>. Implementing the new <a href="https://www.mouser.com/new/octavo-systems/octavo-systems-osd335-sip/">Octavo Systems OSD3358-SM</a> 21x21mm system-in-package with 512MB DDR3 integrated RAM, this pup gives you much bark for your buck. The PocketBeagle is a low cost, open-source development board for educational and professional purposes. Running Linux images customized specifically for BeagleBone and utilizing the web-based <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/">Cloud9 IDE</a>, programmers of all skill levels have much to benefit from the extensive included <a href="https://beagleboard.org/Support/BoneScript">library</a> and comprehensive <a href="https://github.com/beagleboard/pocketbeagle/wiki">wiki</a>.</p><img src="http://beagleboard.org/static/images/PocketBeagle-size-compare-small.jpg" alt="Photo of Pocket Beagle."/><p>Additional information including <a href="https://github.com/beagleboard/pocketbeagle/blob/master/PocketBeagle_sch.pdf">schematics</a> and <a href="https://github.com/beagleboard/pocketbeagle/blob/master/PocketBeagle_BOM.csv">bill of materials</a> are available on <a href="https://github.com/beagleboard/pocketbeagle">GitHub</a>. The PocketBeagle is available from <a href="https://www.arrow.com/en/products/pocketbeagle/beagleboardorg">Arrow</a>, <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/product-highlight/b/beagleboard/pocketbeagle-board?utm_source=online&utm_medium=vanity&utm_campaign=pocketbeagle">Digi-Key</a>, <a href="https://www.newark.com/beagleboard/bb-pocket/silicon-manufacturer-octave-systems/dp/45AC6372">Element14</a>, and <a href="https://www.mouser.com/new/beagleboardorg/pocketbeagle/">Mouser</a>. Additional components called <a href="https://github.com/beagleboard/pocketbeagle/wiki/Click-boards%E2%84%A2">Click Boards</a> give the PocketBeagle even more functionality, from GPS to lightning sensors. We're excited to provide yet another accessible resource to our community to realize their ideas and potential.</p><p><em><strong>â€”Christine Long</strong>, Executive Director</em></p>
